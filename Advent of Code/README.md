# Advent of Code

## SQL - TODO

Create a set of scripts to set up and generate a database to use for solving Advent of Code challenges.

This needs to include a PowerShell script for importing challenge sample data and actual data. Maybe use dbatools to pull from clipboard and insert data into a hard table in the AoC database.

Also need the database to have my custom Regex CLR functions pre-installed.
